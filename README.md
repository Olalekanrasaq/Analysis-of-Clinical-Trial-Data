# Analysis-of-Clinical-Trial-Data
Analysis of Clinical Trial data to identifying factors affecting angiographic disease status of patients.

## Introduction
This project delves into the analysis of the heart disease dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, featuring noninvasive test results from 120 patients undergoing angiography at the Cleveland Clinic in 1988. The primary objective of this study is to identify factors influencing the presence of heart disease in patients.

## Method
Utilizing the R programming language, various appropriate methods are employed for data analysis. The results are visualized through data visualizations such as bar charts, boxplots and others, aiding in the interpretation of findings related to factors affecting development of heart disease. Furthermore, a logistic regression model is fitted on the data to determine the most significant features for heart disease.

## Result
The result showed that number of major vessels, type of chest pain, ST depression and a disease called thalassemia are the main significant features affecting the development of heart disease.

## Discussion
The insights derived from this analysis contribute to a better understanding of the influential factors in heart disease, providing valuable information for medical research and patient care.
